# OS_TutorialCode

**The programs are recommended be compiled and run in a Linux based environment**.

This is a collection of the code I wrote as a learning exercise in a tutorial for the Operating Systems course I had in College. It contains a number of small (and hopefully self explanatory) pieces of code that use some of the commonly used functions and system calls while coding in Linux based operating systems.
